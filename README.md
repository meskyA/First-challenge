# First-challenge
This is my first challenge.
I created a new repository on my GitHub account and cloned it on my computer.
The challenge was to clone a repository from GitLab, modify and push to Github and summit a URL of the GitHub repository.
I changed the non-semantic elements to HTML semantic elemens.
Doing so helped me to identify or define different parts or sections on the web page.
